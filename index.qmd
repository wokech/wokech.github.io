Hi there! Welcome to my teaching and training website. This is a repository for all the teaching and training materials that I am currently using or have previously delivered.

My background is in Biomedical Engineering (with a focus on mechanobiology, cardiovascular physiology, and tissue engineering). My [research interests](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BvIDsDMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) include:

-   Biomechanics and Mechanobiology

-   Exercise Physiology and Biomechanics in Sports

-   Biomedical Device Design and Development

-   Healthcare Data Science

I am also a [Certified Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/community/instructors/) and a trainer with the [Digital Research Academy](https://digital-research.academy/trainers/). I am passionate about training students on the basics of computational thinking, and I am an ardent promoter of using open-source tools (such as R/Python) to solve data analysis and visualization problems.
