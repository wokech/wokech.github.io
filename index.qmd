Hi there! Welcome to my teaching and training website. This is a repository for all the teaching and training materials that I am currently using or have previously delivered.

My background is in Biomedical Engineering, and my [previous work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BvIdsDMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focused on vascular mechanobiology and tissue engineering. Currently, my research interests include:

-   Exercise Physiology and Biomechanics in Sports

-   Healthcare Data Science

-   Accessible Data Visualization for Low-Resource Settings

I am also a [Certified Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/community/instructors/) and a trainer with the [Digital Research Academy](https://digital-research.academy/trainers/). In these roles my goal is to train learners on the basics of computational thinking, and I am an ardent promoter of using open-source tools (such as R/Python) to solve data analysis and visualization problems.
